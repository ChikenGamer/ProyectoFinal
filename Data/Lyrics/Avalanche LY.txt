Words like a loaded gun
Shot out from a fire tongue
Love lost from a fight that was won
And I can see you breaking down
The end to a falling out

I got pride you can't hold your breath
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Look out now, don't take one more step
We'll crash down like an avalanche, 
avalanche

I never wanted it to turn out this way
Now forever feels like yesterday
Sorry something that I just can't say
Can you see me breaking down
The end to a falling out yeah

I got pride you can't hold your breath 
(even if we survive)

We'll crash down like an avalanche 
(crash down, crash down)

Look out now, don't take one more 
step (even if we survive)

We'll crash down like an avalanche 
(crash down, crash down)

Avalanche (oh)

We'll crash down, yeah
Like an avalanche

I got pride you can't hold your breath
We'll crash down like an avalanche
I got pride you can't hold your breath 
(even if we survive)

We'll crash down like an avalanche 
(crash down, crash down)

Look out now, don't take one more step 
(even if we survive)(one more step yeah)

We'll crash down like an avalanche
(Crash down, crash down) Avalanche 

(oh)

(Crash down, crash down) oh

Just like an avalanche
