Someone falls to pieces 
sleeping all alone, someone kills the pain. 
Spinning in the silence 
she finally drifts away. 
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard 
and catches a bouquet. 
Another lays a dozen 
white roses on a grave 

And to be yourself is all that you can do 
To be yourself is all that you can do 

Someone finds salvation in everyone, 
another only pain. 
Someone tries to hide himself 
down inside himself he prays. 
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, 
another runs away. 
Separate or united, 
healthy or insane 

And to be yourself is all that you can do 
To be yourself is all that you can do. 
To be yourself is all that you can do 
To be yourself is all that you can do. 

Even when you've paid enough 
been put upon or been held up. 
Every single memory of 
the good or bad, faces of luck. 
Don't lose any sleep tonight, 
I'm sure everything will end up alright. 
You may win or lose. 

But to be yourself is all that you can do, eh 
To be yourself is all that you can do. 

To be yourself is all that you can do, eh 
To be yourself is all taht you can do. 
And to be yourself is all that you can 
Be yourself is all that you can 
Be yourself is all that you can do.
