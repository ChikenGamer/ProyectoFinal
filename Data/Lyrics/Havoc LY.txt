I wonder what it's like 
To attack at night 
And now down the defenseless 
Invasions and raids just called 
Fucking, punitive expeditions 

Like a wildfire 
Devastation spreads 
Across all Gallia 
From Helvetia to Eburonia 
The ravener's insatiate 

Havoc 
Just think of yesterday 
Ruin 
A mass illusion 
How could it come this far? 

Narbonensis was not enough 
The empire needed more 
From aremorica to carnutia 
Plagued and war-ridden land 
War's inflicted on free Gallia 
An organised downfall 
A black cloud of imperial 
Rapacity unleashed 

Havoc 
Just think of yesterday 

Imperial needs are met 
At the bloody cost of free tribes 
Invasion, raid and war atrocity 
In the name of S.P.Q.R. 

Havoc 
Just think of yesterday 
Ruin 
A mass illusion 
How could it come this far?
