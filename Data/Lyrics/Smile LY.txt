When you first left me 
i was wanting more 
but you were fuc*** that girl next door 
what you do that for 

when you first left me 
i didnt know what to say 
id never been on my own that way 
just sat by myself all day 

i was so lost back then 
but with a little help from my friends 
i found the light in the tunnel at the end 

now you’re calling me up on the phone 
so you can have a little whine and a moan 
and its only because you’re feeling alone 

at first when I see you cry 
yea it makes me smile 
yea it makes me smile 
at worst I feel bad for a while 
but then I just smile 
I go ahead and smile 

whenever you see me 
you say that you want me back 
and I tell you it don’t mean jack 
no it don’t mean jack 

I couldn’t stop laughing 
no I just couldn’t help myself 
see you messed up my mental health 
I was quite unwell 

I was so lost back then 
but with a little help from my friends 
I found the light in the tunnel at the end 

now you’re calling me up on the phone 
so you can have a little whine and a moan 
and its only because you’re feeling alone 

at first when I see you cry 
yea it makes me smile 
yea it makes me smile 
at worst I feel bad for a while 
but then I just smile 
I go ahead and smile
