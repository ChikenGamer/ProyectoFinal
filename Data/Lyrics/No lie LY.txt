Hot piece of gear, mami love how you talk

Watching every step, I dip upon what you got

Stayin' in my brain, I'm 'membering all the touch?

And my aim is to give you this love
Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie or play you
Beam me up like Scottie
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, complain to you
Pull so hypnotic

And let me own it, my girl
Give you all the style that I have mustered

Give you the good lovin' that is preferred

You deserve it, so don't be scared
