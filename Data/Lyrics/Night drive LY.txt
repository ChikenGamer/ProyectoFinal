Purple in the sky
Cruising Highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes

Herbie Hancock on my radio
Ooh let's pull over for the liquor store
Cop some skittles and some Crown Royal
I know we ended things a week ago
Baby fall into me slow

Ooh don't keep your love from me
No no love on me
On that night drive
Ooh you're so fine

Purple in the sky
Cruising highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes

I said now baby we can disappear
Awol like we are some fugitives
Liberation oh so cavalier
Ooh baby take me far away from here
Baby you know I'm sincere

Ooh don't keep your love from me
No no love on me
On that night drive
Ooh you're so fine

Purple in the sky
Cruising highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes
