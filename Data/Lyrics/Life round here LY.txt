Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day

Now we're at square one
And we waited too long
So we're at square one

We're never done

Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day

I wonder how you feel
To be well locked in my mind
So you barely understand my thoughts sometimes
Little bit of death and a little bit of God
Cause I swear that I be livin' in the dark sometimes
And it sets in here, nobody gets let in
Til I let my emotions out on every single page
And instrumental that I'm left with
Shit, I wonder
Will I ever really feel shit?
And if it all takes time and I ask why
Will time eventually reveal this?
Cause
The remedy, I'm searching for the remedy
Cus I'm fucked up and my heart's just
Another ghost in my memory
Knock real hard on real real wood
Things still feel bad when it real real good
And my brain just a vessel and I just feel the hell
But the more you fuckin know less things feel real
Less things feel real
Then the time shifts and my mind shifts
It ain't really anyone or anything
I can really vibe with
Cus I'm searching but I'm terrified
Then bout the time I find what I'm lookin for
I'll be dead inside

Cause part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Never done
We're never done
